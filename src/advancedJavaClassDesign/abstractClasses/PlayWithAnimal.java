/*
The correct answer is toss in meat . The main method creates a new Lion and calls
careFor . Since only the Animal superclass has a careFor method, it executes. That method
calls play . Java looks for overridden methods, and it sees that Lion implements play .
Even though the call is from the Animal class, Java still looks at subclasses, which is good
because you donâ€™t want to pet a Lion !
