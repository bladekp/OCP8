■ They do not have an access specifier.

one is effectively final. It is only set in the line in which it is declared. two is not effec-
tively final. The value is changed on line 37 after it is declared. three is effectively final
because it is assigned only once. This assignment may happen in either branch of the if
statement, but it can happen in only one of them. four is not effectively final. Even though
the assignment happens after the inner class, it is not allowed.
