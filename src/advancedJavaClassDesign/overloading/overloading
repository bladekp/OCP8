For overloading, the method parameters must vary by type and/or number. When 
multiple overloaded methods are present, Java looks for the closest match first. 
It tries to find the following:
■ Exact match by type
■ Matching a superclass type
■ Converting to a larger primitive type
■ Converting to an autoboxed type
■ Varargs
