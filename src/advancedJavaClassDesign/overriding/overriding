Overriding occurs only when the method signature is the same. The method 
signature is the method name and the parameter list.
For overriding, the overridden method has a few rules:
■ The access modifier must be the same or more accessible.
■ The return type must be the same or a more restrictive type, also known as covariant
return types.
■ If any checked exceptions are thrown, only the same exceptions or subclasses of those
exceptions are allowed to be thrown.
